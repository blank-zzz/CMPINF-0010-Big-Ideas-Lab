Responsibility:
Leaders such as the copyright holders and any distributors are responsible for upholding the pledges, values, and standards for behavior disclaimed above. Leaders must periodically both remind and enforce standards to the community. Leaders have the responsibility and right to modify, remove, or reject commits, codes, edits, comments, and any and all contributions that do not align with the Code of Conduct. 

Scope:
The Code of Conduct applies to all within the open source project, as well as is applicable when an individual is representing the project or any portions of its code to the general public or in public spaces. This includes, but are not limited to, social media, emails, events, or any social 
interactions with members of the general public. 

Enforcement: 
Any instances of violating the Code of Conduct will be reported and trigger an enforcement of the following guidelines below. Any and all complaints will be reviewed and investigated by the leaders promptly and fairly. Leaders are responsible to respect the member issuing the complaint, and respect their privacy and wishes. Any subsequent violations will trigger the following guidelines below: 

Guidelines for Enforcement: 
1. Warning: Leaders will give an explicit warning to the violator, as well as explaining what specific violation in the Code of Conduct they failed to uphold. The violators must be ordered to apologize (public or private, according to the wishes of the subject the violator mistreated) 

2. Community Alert: Subsequent violations will trigger a community response. Leaders will repeat the following steps, but in addition will alert the community of the violations. The Code of Conduct will be repeated and emphasized in a statement, and the community will be warned about the individual. The violator must apologize to the subject they mistreated. 

3. Temporary/Permanent Ban

Repeated or any serious violations will be alerted to the community. Leaders will then assess the safety risk of harboring the individual in the community. In the event of repeated violations or explicit/implicit threats have been made by the violator, the violator will then be temporarily or permanently banned. The community will be alerted and informed through all steps of the process, and the Code of Conduct is then emphasized again. The mistreated subject must be supported and their wishes respected throughout the process; they must be included in any and all decisions.
